              Hello, I'm Shreyash Vidhate, a passionate and ambitious Frontend
              Developer from India. As a 2024 graduate, I bring fresh ideas, a
              strong foundation in web technologies, and a drive to create
              intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. My journey in
              frontend development has equipped me with a deep understanding of
              HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS JavaScript, React and Redux and I'm
              constantly learning and experimenting to stay at the forefront of
              the latest trends and best practices.
              <br />
              <br />
              I thrive in collaborative environments where I can combine
              creativity with technical expertise to solve real-world problems.
              My goal is to build seamless and engaging digital experiences that
              leave a lasting impression.
              <br />
              <br />
